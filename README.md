# Nested-Fold-corss-validation
This Python function, nested_cv_roc_analysis_DF, is designed to perform nested cross-validation on a given dataset using a specified machine learning model and parameter grid. The function is particularly useful for evaluating model performance in scenarios where hyperparameter tuning is critical and overfitting is a concern. It is tailored for use with datasets provided as Pandas DataFrames, making it highly suitable for data science projects where data manipulation and analysis are primarily conducted using Pandas.

Key Features:

Nested Cross-Validation: Utilizes an outer cross-validation loop to assess model performance and an inner loop for hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV. This approach provides a more robust evaluation by separating the data used for model training and hyperparameter selection from the data used for performance assessment.

ROC Curve Analysis: For each fold in the outer loop, the function plots Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for both the inner loop's average performance and the outer loop's test set performance. This visual representation helps in understanding the model's discriminative ability across different threshold settings.

Parameter Flexibility: Accepts a variety of inputs including the model, parameter grid, feature and target data (X and y), and control parameters for the cross-validation process (repeat_times, outer_cv_splits, and inner_cv_splits). The prob parameter allows users to specify whether the model should utilize probability estimates, making the function adaptable to different model requirements.

Comprehensive Results: Outputs a Pandas DataFrame summarizing the experiment repetition number, the fold number within the outer loop, the best hyperparameters found for each fold, and the AUC scores for both the inner and outer loops. This structured output makes it easy to analyze and compare model performance across different iterations and folds.


Intended Use: This function is ideal for researchers and data scientists seeking to rigorously evaluate the performance of classification models, particularly in biomedical research, finance, or any field where model reliability is paramount. By employing nested cross-validation, it addresses the common pitfall of hyperparameter tuning potentially biasing model performance estimates. The function's output provides a detailed account of model efficacy, making it an invaluable tool for scientific studies, model selection, and performance reporting.
